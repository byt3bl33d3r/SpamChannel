# SpamChannel

Live worker hosted at https://spamchannel.haxxx.workers.dev

**UPDATE (Aug 13 2023): Two days after my DEFCON 31 talk, MailChannels silently decided to require a [Domain Lockdown Record](https://support.mailchannels.com/hc/en-us/articles/16918954360845) in order to send emails from Cloudflare Workers meaning this code doesn't work anymore. However, because they just addressed a "symptom" and not the underlying issue (lack of sender idenitity verification) anyone can still signup on their website (80$) and use their "normal" SMTP relay to spoof all of their customer domains ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

## What is this

As of writing, This allows you to spoof emails from any of the +2 Million domains using MailChannels. It also gives you a slightly higher chance of landing a spoofed emails from any domain that doesn't have an SPF & DMARC due to [ARC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8617.html#) adoption.

It was released at the Defcon 31 talk [SpamChannel: Spoofing Emails From 2 Million+ Domains and Virtually Becoming Satan](https://forum.defcon.org/node/245722).

Slides for the talk are [here](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/Slides/blob/master/Defcon31_SpamChannel_Spoofing_Emails_from_2M_Domains.pdf)

## I'm a MailChannels customer, how do I stop people from impersonating my domain?

TL;DR set your [Domain Lockdown Record](https://support.mailchannels.com/hc/en-us/articles/16918954360845) ASAP.

## Demos

Below are the demos from my Defcon talk demonstrating email spoofing using this Cloudflare Worker.

This video demonstrates spoofing an email from a domain configured with DMARC + DKIM:
